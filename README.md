Summary of Pocket Analysis Project

![Alt Text](Picture1.png)

This project focused on analyzing the stability and characteristics of a ligand-binding pocket in a protein structure originally containing a bound ligand. The ligand was removed, and the protein was subjected to molecular dynamics (MD) simulations to observe conformational changes and assess pocket stability over time.

Using Fpocket and MDpocket, the volume, druggability, and physicochemical descriptors of the pocket were evaluated at key time points (e.g., 0 ns, 50 ns, and 100 ns). Additional structural analyses—including RMSD, RMSF, SASA, and radius of gyration—were performed specifically for the pocket region to monitor its dynamic behavior throughout the simulation.
